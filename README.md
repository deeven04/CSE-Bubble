# CSE-BUBBLE

This is a project done in the course CS220 - Computer Organization.

In this project we learnt to develope a processor (CSE-BUBBLE) following a systematic Processor Development Strategy, including register design, memory allocation, instruction layout, ALU implementation, control signal finite state machine, and successful execution of MIPS code for Bubble Sort with results stored in data memory.

The details of the processor is in cse_bubble.pdf and the implemented codes in the respective PDS files.
